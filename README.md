# habitica-scheduleQuestStart
Script that can force quests to be started after a period of time.  Default is 4hrs but the end user can edit the script to change this value.  A spreadsheet tab controls if messages are sent to users that opt-in to quest completion messages.  The spreadsheet name can be changed in the script to allow for the tab to be added to your own guild management spreadsheet.
